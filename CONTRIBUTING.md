-   `backend/`: The Python FastAPI application, which serves the main API.
    
-   `sandbox-engine/`: Contains the specific Dockerfiles and scripts for the Cyber Sandbox labs.
    
-   `ai/`: Contains notebooks, training scripts, and models for all AI/ML features.
    
-   `infra/`: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts for deployment.
    
-   `docs/`: Project documentation.
    
-   `tests/`: All automated tests for the project.
    

When contributing, please ensure your changes are made in the relevant directory.
